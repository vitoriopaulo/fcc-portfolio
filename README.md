# Portfolio - freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Course Capstone Project

## Introduction

This is the capstone project of the **freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Course**: a portfolio showcasing all the projects designed and developed throughout the course. Although primarily focused on **HTML** and **CSS**, I gave a final touch by implementing **JavaScript** to improve the interactivity of each web app. 

I'm happy with the results achieved and hope you enjoy exploring this portfolio as much as I enjoyed building it!

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to **Quincy Larson**, the CEO of freeCodeCamp, and the entire staff and volunteers worldwide who contribute to making freeCodeCamp a leading platform for high-quality, free tech education globally.
